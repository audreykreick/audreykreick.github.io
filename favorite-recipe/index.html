            <h2>Crust Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cube butter</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut each stick of butter into 8 pieces, and refrigerate until needed</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Mix dry ingredients</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the flour, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl, and mix to combine</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Incorporate butter into dry ingredients</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the chilled butter. Using a pastry blender, incorporate the butter into the flour mixture; the mixture should resemble coarse meal with small pieces of butter, the size of small peas, remaining visible</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Finish mixing dough</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drizzle 2 TBS ice water over the flour-butter mixture, and blend. Repeat with an additional 2 TBS water. At this point, you may have to add more water: When a handful of dough squeezed together just holds its shape, you've added enough; if the dough crumbles, continue adding water, 1 TBS at a time, checking the consistency after each additional TBS</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Divide dough</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. Divide into two equal pieces, and place on two seperate sheets of plastic wrap.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Form into disks and chill</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Flatten, and form two disks of dough. Wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <h2>Pie Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare and roll out pastry. Line a 9-inch pie plate with half of the pastry; set aside in the fridge</li>
                <li>If desired, sprinkle apples with lemon juice. In a large mixing bowl stir together sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add apple slices. Gently toss to coat.</li>
                <li>Transfer apple mixture to the pastry-lined pie plate. Trim pastry to edge of pie plate. Cut slits in remaining pastry; place on filling and seal. Crimp edge as desired</li>
                <li>To prevent overbrowning, cover edge of pie with foil. Bake in 375 degree oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes more or until top is golden. Cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
