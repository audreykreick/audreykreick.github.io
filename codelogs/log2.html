	<h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>

    <h2>Absolute vs Relative CSS Length Units</h2>

    <p>The term semantic refers to the meaning of the text. Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance. A semantic element clearly defines its meaning to both the developer and the browser. The purpose of using semantic tags is to organize the script based on the meaning of the HTML element, instead of how it looks. Using these tags can also help someone without coding knowledge understand why a piece of content was placed in a certain spot. As HTML5 is relatively new, the use of non-semantic elements is still very common on today's websites. Below are a few examples of semantic and non-semantic tags.</p>

    <p><b>Non-semantic tags</b></p>

    <textarea cols="30" rows="6">
<div id ="header"></div>
<div id ="section"></div>
<div id ="aside"></div>
<div id ="article"></div>
<div id ="footer"></div>
    </textarea>

     <p><b>Semantic tags</b></p>

    <textarea cols="30" rows="6">
<header></header>
<section></section>
<aside></aside>
<article></article>
<footer></footer>
    </textarea>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Semantic Tags</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO):</b> HTML semantic elements are included in Google's algorithms. Search engines use HTML to decipher the content and goal of a webpage.</li>
        <li><b>Accessibility:</b> It is easier for everyone, including people with disabilities, to navigate a website if a foundation of semantic HTML is being used.</li>
        <li><b>Browser Compatibility:</b> HTML semantic tags make sure that your code can be integrated with future technologies.</li>
    </ul>
