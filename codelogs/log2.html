    <h2>Absolute vs Relative CSS Length Units</h2>

    <p>The term absolute when talking about CSS length units means that the units are not relative to anything else. They are generally considered to always be the same size. Most of absolute units are more useful when used for print, instead of screen output. Relative lenth units, on the other hand, are relative to something else. A benefit of using relative units is that you can make it so that the size of text or other elements scales are relative to everything else on the page. Below are some examples of both absolute and relative length units.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Semantic Tags</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO):</b> HTML semantic elements are included in Google's algorithms. Search engines use HTML to decipher the content and goal of a webpage.</li>
        <li><b>Accessibility:</b> It is easier for everyone, including people with disabilities, to navigate a website if a foundation of semantic HTML is being used.</li>
        <li><b>Browser Compatibility:</b> HTML semantic tags make sure that your code can be integrated with future technologies.</li>
    </ul>
